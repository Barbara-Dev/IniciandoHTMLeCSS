        Dear daddy, I'm coming home!
        I know you don't remember me
        But I used to be your doll
        I used to be your princess
        Your heart and your soul
        I used to be your angel
        But always alone
        In an empty house of stolen dreams and broken hearts

        I'm done
        I'm done drowning in these tears of sorrow
        I'm done
        I'm done drowning in these tears of sorrow
        Sorrow

        'Cause I can fly with no wings
        Shine in the night with an eternal fire
        The art inside me is unleashed
        I'm naked now in obscene colors
        'Cause I can fly with no wings
        Shine in the night with an eternal fire
        The art inside me is unleashed
        I'm naked now in obscene colors

        Dear mom, I'm coming home!
        I hope you are proud of me
        I am not alone anymore
        I found a reason to live
        A reason to breathe
        I found a place in this world
        For my orphan soul
        For my orphan soul
        My empty house of stolen dreams and broken hearts

        'Cause I can fly with no wings
        Shine in the night with an eternal fire
        The art inside me is unleashed
        I'm naked now in obscene colors
        'Cause I can fly with no wings
        Shine in the night with an eternal fire
        The art inside me is unleashed
        I'm naked now in obscene colors

        I'm done
        I'm done drowning in these tears of sorrow
        Suffocating in the endless hollow, suffocating
        Burning in this freezing, scary silence
        I'm getting tired and old while waiting for something
        Waiting for something
        Waiting for something
        Waiting for something
